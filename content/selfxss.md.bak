Title: (Self) XSS at Mozilla's internal Phonebook

This is a short summary about a goofy XSS/CSRF exploit on an internal
webpage at Mozilla.
A few weeks ago I discovered that our "phonebook" supports a limited
wikisyntax in the profile descriptions. Despite proper sanitizing to
forbid all markup injections into HTML tags and attributes it allowed
linking to `javascript` URIs. Liking the rich capabilities that come with
JavaScript, I naturally had to insert some script into my profile.
So I started with a small script that changes the background color randomly.
Like this:

```
setInterval("document.body.style.backgroundColor='#'+(Math.random()*10e16).toString(16).substr(0,6)",500)
```

What it does? Well, let's start simple. `setInterval(…,500)` runs the
code supplied in the first argument every 500ms. The code itself is an
assignment to the document's background color. So we change it quite often.
The rest is a quick way to generate a random six digits hex string, i.e.
an RGB color value: `Math.random()` gives a float with a lot of random
digits after the floating point. Multiplying by 10e16 (that is a 10
followed by 16 zeros) makes it a long integer without decimals. `toString(16)`
transforms it into a hex string and `substr` cuts after six digits. Et violà!
