Hi,

my name is <strong class="noboldstrong">Frederik Braun</strong> and I currently work as a Staff Security Engineer at
Mozilla. This blog's content is heavily influenced by my work in security,
but it is a personal blog and opinions do not reflect anyone else's than mine.

If you are using a CDN to serve your website's JavaScript files, you might
want to look into [Subresource Integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity),
which became a [W3C Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/) in 2016.

In the fall of 2013 I have co-authored a whitepaper about [the
benefits of the X-Frame-Options security header](xfo-clickjacking.pdf) with [Mario
Heiderich](http://heideri.ch/). It mostly shows
attacks and techniques against website that _can_ be framed.

I once wrote a [thesis](/pages/publications.html "Origin Policy Enforcement in Modern Browsers")
about the Same Origin Policy and its state in the API-rich HTML5
browsers in Summer 2012, which concluded my studies of IT-Security at the
[Ruhr-University](https://www.rub.de/) in Bochum. This is also where I co-founded
the CTF team [fluxfingers](https://fluxfingers.net).

If you still want to know more, I suggest you read some of my [blog posts](archives.html).
