Here's a list of thigs that currently occupy my thoughts. Inspired by [Derek Sivers' "now" page](https://sive.rs/now).

### Life

- spending time with my kids.
- trying to blog more about web security.

### Work

- learning the ropes as a new manager.
- getting better at planning ahead.
- securing the web :)

### Reading

- *Managing Humans* by Michael Lopp.
- *Crossroads* by Jonathan Franzen.

## Looking foward

- conferences and meeting people again
- three weeks of vacation in the summer: through the Netherlands with the wife, the kids, a tent and our bikes.
