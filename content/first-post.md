Title: The First Post

Summary: This is the first post, expect something meta.

This is the first post of hopefully many. This blog will share
recent events within the security community and Mozilla in general.
My posts will be short digests, bundling old and new gossip in a
short, weekly write-up.
Naturally, some of the work presented is not actually done by me. I'm
just the messenger :) 

**Update:** I have moved away from the weekly digests format.
